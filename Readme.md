# Scripts

A collection of npm "scripts" that I use to manage the different types of projects that I work on. These scripts are designed to enable me to get up and running on new projects with minimal effort. Mostly they're just thin wrappers around existing tools, but they will also rely on and enforce certain conventions to help reduce boilerplate and configuration. 

> **Warning**: this project is primarily for my personal use. Feel free to file issues, but I don't make any gaurantees that I'll get to them. Instead, I would encourage you to fork this repository and make your own personal set of scripts!
